# kubernetes_config_map

The resource provides mechanisms to inject containers with configuration data while keeping containers agnostic of Kubernetes.
Config Map can be used to store fine-grained information like individual properties or coarse-grained information like entire config files or JSON blobs.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "kubernetes_config_map" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "my-config"
  }

  data = {
    api_host             = "myhost:443"
    db_host              = "dbhost:5432"
    "my_config_file.yml" = "${file("${path.module}/my_config_file.yml")}"
  }

  binary_data = {
    "my_payload.bin" = "${filebase64("${path.module}/my_payload.bin")}"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `binary_data` - (Optional) BinaryData contains the binary data. Each key must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.'. BinaryData can contain byte sequences that are not in the UTF-8 range. The keys stored in BinaryData must not overlap with the ones in the Data field, this is enforced during validation process. Using this field will require 1.10+ apiserver and kubelet. This field only accepts base64-encoded payloads that will be decoded/received before being sent/received to the apiserver.
* `data` - (Optional) Data contains the configuration data. Each key must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.'. Values with non-UTF-8 byte sequences must use the BinaryData field. The keys stored in Data must not overlap with the keys in the BinaryData field, this is enforced during validation process.
* `metadata` - (Required) Standard config map's metadata. For more info see [Kubernetes reference](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata)

## Nested Blocks

### `metadata`

#### Arguments

* `annotations` - (Optional) An unstructured key value map stored with the config map that may be used to store arbitrary metadata.
**By default, the provider ignores any annotations whose key names end with *kubernetes.io*. This is necessary because such annotations can be mutated by server-side components and consequently cause a perpetual diff in the Terraform plan output. If you explicitly specify any such annotations in the configuration template then Terraform will consider these as normal resource attributes and manage them as expected (while still avoiding the perpetual diff problem).**
For more info see [Kubernetes reference](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations)
* `generate_name` - (Optional) Prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the `name` field has not been provided. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. For more info see [Kubernetes reference](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency)
* `labels` - (Optional) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) the config map. May match selectors of replication controllers and services.
**By default, the provider ignores any labels whose key names end with *kubernetes.io*. This is necessary because such labels can be mutated by server-side components and consequently cause a perpetual diff in the Terraform plan output. If you explicitly specify any such labels in the configuration template then Terraform will consider these as normal resource attributes and manage them as expected (while still avoiding the perpetual diff problem).**
For more info see [Kubernetes reference](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels)
* `name` - (Optional) Name of the config map, must be unique. Cannot be updated. For more info see [Kubernetes reference](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names)
* `namespace` - (Optional) Namespace defines the space within which name of the config map must be unique.

#### Attributes

* `generation` - A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
* `resource_version` - An opaque value that represents the internal version of this config map that can be used by clients to determine when config map has changed. For more info see [Kubernetes reference](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency)
* `self_link` - A URL representing this config map.
* `uid` - The unique in time and space value for this config map. For more info see [Kubernetes reference](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids)

## Import

Config Map can be imported using its namespace and name, e.g.

```
$ terraform import kubernetes_config_map.example default/my-config
```
