```release-note:note
We have updated the logic of resources that use the Pod specification template, such as `kubernetes_deployment_v1`, `kubernetes_stateful_set_v1`, etc, and now the provider will keep all tolerations(`spec.toleration`) returned by Kubernetes. The same is applicable for the data sources `kubernetes_pod_v1` and `kubernetes_pod`. The behavior of resources `kubernetes_pod_v1` and `kubernetes_pod` remains unchanged, i.e. the provider will keep removing tolerations with well-known [taints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/) since they might be attached to the object by Kubernetes controller and could lead to a perpetual diff.
