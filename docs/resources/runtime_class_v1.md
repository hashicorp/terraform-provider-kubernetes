# kubernetes_runtime_class_v1

A runtime class is used to determine which container runtime is used to run all containers in a pod.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `handler` (String) Specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class
- `metadata` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Standard runtimeclass's metadata. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) An unstructured key value map stored with the runtimeclass that may be used to store arbitrary metadata. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/
- `generate_name` (String) Prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the `name` field has not been provided. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) the runtimeclass. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
- `name` (String) Name of the runtimeclass, must be unique. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

Read-Only:

- `generation` (Number) A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this runtimeclass that can be used by clients to determine when runtimeclass has changed. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) The unique in time and space value for this runtimeclass. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids




## Example usage

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_runtime_class_v1" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "myclass"
  }
  handler = "abcdeagh"
}
```

## Import

Runtime class can be imported using the name only, e.g.

```
$ terraform import kubernetes_runtime_class_v1.example myclass
```
