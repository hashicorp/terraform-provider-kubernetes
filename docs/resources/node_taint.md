# kubernetes_node_taint

[Node affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of [nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))
- `taint` (Block List, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--taint))

### Optional

- `field_manager` (String) Set the name of the field manager for the node taint
- `force` (Boolean) Force overwriting annotations that were created or edited outside of Terraform.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the node


<a id="nestedblock--taint"></a>
### Nested Schema for `taint`

Required:

- `effect` (String) The taint effect
- `key` (String) The taint key
- `value` (String) The taint value




## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_node_taint" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "my-node.my-cluster.k8s.local"
  }
  taint {
    key    = "node-role.kubernetes.io/example"
    value  = "true"
    effect = "NoSchedule"
  }
}
```

## Import

This resource does not support the `import` command. As this resource operates on Kubernetes resources that already exist, creating the resource is equivalent to importing it.
