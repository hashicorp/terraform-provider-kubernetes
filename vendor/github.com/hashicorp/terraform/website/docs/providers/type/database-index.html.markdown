# Database Providers

This is a group of database providers offer specific capabilities to provision
and configure your database resources. Terraform integrates with these
database services using the specific provider to provision and manages database
resources. These providers are primarily supported by the vendor in close
collaboration with HashiCorp, and are tested by HashiCorp.
