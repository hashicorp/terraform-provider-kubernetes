# kubernetes_config_map_v1_data

This resource allows Terraform to manage data within a pre-existing ConfigMap. This resource uses [field management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#field-management) and [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/) to manage only the data that is defined in the Terraform configuration. Existing data not specified in the configuration will be ignored. If data specified in the config and is already managed by another client it will cause a conflict which can be overridden by setting `force` to true.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `data` (Map of String) The data we want to add to the ConfigMap.
- `metadata` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))

### Optional
- `binary_data` (Map of String) BinaryData contains the binary data. Each key must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.'. BinaryData can contain byte sequences that are not in the UTF-8 range. The keys stored in BinaryData must not overlap with the ones in the Data field, this is enforced during validation process. Using this field will require 1.10+ apiserver and kubelet. This field only accepts base64-encoded payloads that will be decoded/encoded before being sent/received to/from the apiserver.
- `field_manager` (String) Set the name of the field manager for the specified labels.
- `force` (Boolean) Force overwriting data that is managed outside of Terraform.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the ConfigMap.

Optional:

- `namespace` (String) The namespace of the ConfigMap.




## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_config_map_v1_data" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "my-config"
  }
  data = {
    "owner" = "myteam"
  }
  binary_data = {
    "logo.png" = "HxShiC0rp..."
  }
}
```

## Import

This resource does not support the `import` command. As this resource operates on Kubernetes resources that already exist, creating the resource is equivalent to importing it.
