# kubernetes_certificate_signing_request

Use this resource to generate TLS certificates using Kubernetes. This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform state and does not persist any external managed resources. This resource enables automation of [X.509](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509) credential provisioning (including TLS/SSL certificates). It does this by creating a CertificateSigningRequest using the Kubernetes API, which generates a certificate from the Certificate Authority (CA) configured in the Kubernetes cluster. The CSR can be approved automatically by Terraform, or it can be approved by a custom controller running in Kubernetes. See [Kubernetes reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) for all available options pertaining to CertificateSigningRequests.

## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Standard certificate signing request's metadata. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metadata))
- `spec` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Describes a certificate signing request (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--spec))

### Optional

- `auto_approve` (Boolean) Automatically approve the CertificateSigningRequest
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `certificate` (String) If request was approved, the controller will place the issued certificate here.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metadata`

Optional:

- `annotations` (Map of String) An unstructured key value map stored with the certificate signing request that may be used to store arbitrary metadata. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/
- `generate_name` (String) Prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the `name` field has not been provided. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) the certificate signing request. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
- `name` (String) Name of the certificate signing request, must be unique. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

Read-Only:

- `generation` (Number) A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
- `resource_version` (String) An opaque value that represents the internal version of this certificate signing request that can be used by clients to determine when certificate signing request has changed. More info: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
- `uid` (String) The unique in time and space value for this certificate signing request. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids


<a id="nestedblock--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `request` (String) Base64-encoded PKCS#10 CSR data

Optional:

- `signer_name` (String) Requested signer for the request. It is a qualified name in the form: `scope-hostname.io/name`.If empty, it will be defaulted: 1. If it's a kubelet client certificate, it is assigned `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet`.2. If it's a kubelet serving certificate, it is assigned `kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving`.3. Otherwise, it is assigned `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown`. Distribution of trust for signers happens out of band.You can select on this field using `spec.signerName`.
- `usages` (Set of String) allowedUsages specifies a set of usage contexts the key will be valid for. See:
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3
	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12

Valid values are:
 "signing",
 "digital signature",
 "content commitment",
 "key encipherment",
 "key agreement",
 "data encipherment",
 "cert sign",
 "crl sign",
 "encipher only",
 "decipher only",
 "any",
 "server auth",

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)




## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_certificate_signing_request" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "example"
  }
  spec {
    usages  = ["client auth", "server auth"]
    request = <<EOT
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
EOT
  }
  auto_approve = true
}


resource "kubernetes_secret" "example" {
  metadata {
    name = "example"
  }
  data = {
    "tls.crt" = kubernetes_certificate_signing_request.example.certificate
    "tls.key" = tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem # key used to generate Certificate Request
  }
  type = "kubernetes.io/tls"
}
```

## Generating a New Certificate

Since the certificate is a logical resource that lives only in the Terraform state, it will persist until it is explicitly destroyed by the user.

In order to force the generation of a new certificate within an existing state, the certificate instance can be "tainted":

```
terraform taint kubernetes_certificate_signing_request.example
```

A new certificate will then be generated on the next `terraform apply`.
