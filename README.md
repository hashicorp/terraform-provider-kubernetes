## Requirements


-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.11.x (to build the provider plugin)

## Building The Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-kubernetes`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-kubernetes
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-kubernetes
$ make build
```

Statically linking binaries can be required for testing development builds in containers not providing all dependencies, e.g.:

```
# CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -a -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"'
```

## Developing the Provider

### Contributing Resources

In order to prevent breaking changes and migration of user-created resources, resources included in this provider will be limited to stable (aka `v1`) and beta APIs (with beta resources, readiness for inclusion will be assessed individually). You can find `v1` resources in the Kubernetes [API documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-reference) for the appropriate version of Kubernetes.

### Development Environment

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.9+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-kubernetes
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
