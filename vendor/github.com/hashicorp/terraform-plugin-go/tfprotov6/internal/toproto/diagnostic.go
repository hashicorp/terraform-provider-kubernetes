// forceValidUTF8 returns a string guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 even if the
// input isn't, by replacing any invalid bytes with a valid UTF-8 encoding of
// the Unicode Replacement Character (\uFFFD).
//
// The protobuf serialization library will reject invalid UTF-8 with an
// unhelpful error message:
//
//	string field contains invalid UTF-8
//
// Passing a string result through this function makes invalid UTF-8 instead
// emerge as placeholder characters on the other side of the wire protocol,
// giving a better chance of still returning a partially-legible message
// instead of a generic character encoding error.
//
// This is intended for user-facing messages such as diagnostic summary and
// detail messages, where Terraform will just treat the value as opaque and
// it's ultimately up to the user and their terminal or web browser to
// interpret the result. Don't use this for strings that have machine-readable

	//
	// Any invalid string will grow at least a little larger as a result of
	// this operation because we'll be replacing each invalid byte with
	// the three-byte sequence \xEF\xBF\xBD, which is the UTF-8 encoding of
