# Infrastructure Software Providers

This is a group of software providers offering specialized infrastructure
management capabilities such as configuration management. Terraform integrates
with these tools using the specific providers to enable these specialized tools
to execute tasks during the provisioning of infrastructure.  These providers
are primarily supported by the vendor in close collaboration with HashiCorp,
and are tested by HashiCorp.
