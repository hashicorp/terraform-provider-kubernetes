# How To Use

Kubernetes Provider uses `go-changelog` to generate its changelog on release:

* https://github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog

To install, run the following commands:

```
go install github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog/cmd/changelog-build
go install github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog/cmd/changelog-entry
```

Either command can be ran with the following make command:

```
make changelog
make changelog-entry
```

## CHANGELOG entry examples

CHANGELOG entries are expected to be txt files created inside this folder
`.changelog`. The file name is expected to be the same pull request number that will
be linked when the CHANGELOG is generated. So for example, if your pull request is
\#1234, your file name would be `.changelog/1234.txt`.

While for git commit messages, we expect the leading subject to be more specific
as to the section it updates, for example a change with k8s might be:

```
builtin/k8s: Add support for feature Y

This commit adds support for feature Y....
```

The changelog entry should be more user facing friendly, so it would instead read:

~~~
```release-note:improvement
plugin/k8s: Add support for feature Y
```
~~~

Below are some examples of how to generate a CHANGELOG entry with your pull
request.

### Improvement

~~~
```release-note:improvement
server: Add new option for configs
```
~~~

### Feature

~~~
```release-note:feature
plugin/nomad: New feature integration

```release-note:bug
plugin/docker: Fix broken code

~~~

### Long Description with Markdown

~~~
```release-note:feature
cli: Lorem ipsum dolor `sit amet`, _consectetur_ adipiscing elit, **sed** do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

## How to generate CHANGELOG entries for release

Below is an example for running `go-changelog` to generate a collection of
entries. It will generate output that can be inserted into CHANGELOG.md.

For more information as to what each flag does, make sure to run `changelog-build -help`.

```
changelog-build -last-release v0.5.0 -entries-dir .changelog/ -changelog-template changelog.tmpl -note-template note.tmpl -this-release 86b6b38faa7c69f26f1d4c71e271cd4285daadf9
