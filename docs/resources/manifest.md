# kubernetes_manifest

Represents one Kubernetes resource by supplying a `manifest` attribute. The manifest value is the HCL representation of a Kubernetes YAML manifest. To convert an existing manifest from YAML to HCL, you can use the Terraform built-in function [`yamldecode()`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/yamldecode.html) or [tfk8s](https://github.com/jrhouston/tfk8s).

Once applied, the `object` attribute contains the state of the resource as returned by the Kubernetes API, including all default values.

~> A minimum Terraform version of 0.14.8 is required to use this resource.

## Schema

### Required

- `manifest` (Dynamic) A Kubernetes manifest describing the desired state of the resource in HCL format.

### Optional

- `computed_fields` (List of String) List of manifest fields whose values can be altered by the API server during 'apply'. Defaults to: ["metadata.annotations", "metadata.labels"]
- `field_manager` (Block List, Max: 1) Configure field manager options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--field_manager))
- `object` (Dynamic) The resulting resource state, as returned by the API server after applying the desired state from `manifest`.

### Before you use this resource

- This resource requires API access during planning time. This means the cluster has to be accessible at plan time and thus cannot be created in the same apply operation. We recommend only using this resource for custom resources or resources not yet fully supported by the provider.

- This resource uses [Server-side Apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/) to carry out apply operations. A minimum Kubernetes version of 1.16.x is required, but versions 1.17+ are strongly recommended as the SSA implementation in Kubernetes 1.16.x is incomplete and unstable.

### Example: Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test-configmap" {
  manifest = {
    "apiVersion" = "v1"
    "kind"       = "ConfigMap"
    "metadata" = {
      "name"      = "test-config"
      "namespace" = "default"
    }
    "data" = {
      "foo" = "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Create a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test-crd" {
  manifest = {
    apiVersion = "apiextensions.k8s.io/v1"
    kind       = "CustomResourceDefinition"

    metadata = {
      name = "testcrds.hashicorp.com"
    }

    spec = {
      group = "hashicorp.com"

      names = {
        kind   = "TestCrd"
        plural = "testcrds"
      }

      scope = "Namespaced"

      versions = [{
        name    = "v1"
        served  = true
        storage = true
        schema = {
          openAPIV3Schema = {
            type = "object"
            properties = {
              data = {
                type = "string"
              }
              refs = {
                type = "number"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Importing existing Kubernetes resources as `kubernetes_manifest`

Objects already present in a Kubernetes cluster can be imported into Terraform to be managed as `kubernetes_manifest` resources. Follow these steps to import a resource:

### Extract the resource from Kubernetes and transform it into Terraform configuration

```
kubectl get secrets sample -o yaml | tfk8s --strip -o sample.tf
```

### Import the resource state from the cluster

```
terraform import kubernetes_manifest.secret_sample "apiVersion=v1,kind=Secret,namespace=default,name=sample"
```

Note the import ID as the last argument to the import command. This ID points Terraform at which Kubernetes object to read when importing. It should be constructed with the following syntax: `"apiVersion=<string>,kind=<string>,[namespace=<string>,]name=<string>"`. The `namespace=<string>` in the ID string is required only for Kubernetes namespaced objects and should be omitted for cluster-wide objects.

## Using `wait` to block create and update calls

The `kubernetes_manifest` resource supports the ability to block create and update calls until a field is set or has a particular value by specifying the `wait` block. This is useful for when you create resources like Jobs and Services when you want to wait for something to happen after the resource is created by the API server before Terraform should consider the resource created.

`wait` supports supports a `fields` attribute which allows you specify a map of fields paths to regular expressions. You can also specify `*` if you just want to wait for a field to have any value.

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test" {
  manifest = {
    // ...
  }

  wait {
    fields = {
      # Check the phase of a pod
      "status.phase" = "Running"

      # Check a container's status
      "status.containerStatuses[0].ready" = "true",

      # Check an ingress has an IP
      "status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip" = "^(\\d+(\\.|$)){4}"

      # Check the replica count of a Deployment
      "status.readyReplicas" = "2"
    }
  }

  timeouts {
    create = "10m"
    update = "10m"
    delete = "30s"
  }
}
```

The `wait` block also supports a `rollout` attribute which will wait for rollout to complete on Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet resources.

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test" {
  manifest = {
    // ...
  }

  wait {
    rollout = true
  }
}
```

You can also wait for specified conditions to be met by specifying a `condition` block.

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test" {
  manifest = {
    // ...
  }

  wait {
    condition {
      type   = "ContainersReady"
      status = "True"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuring `field_manager`

The `kubernetes_manifest` exposes configuration of the field manager through the optional `field_manager` block.

```terraform
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test" {
  provider = kubernetes-alpha

  manifest = {
    // ...
  }

  field_manager {
    # set the name of the field manager
    name = "myteam"

    # force field manager conflicts to be overridden
    force_conflicts = true
  }
}
```

## Computed fields

When setting the value of an field in configuration, Terraform will check that the same value is returned after the apply operation. This ensures that the actual configuration requested by the user is successfully applied. In some cases, with the Kubernetes API this is not the desired behavior. Particularly when using mutating admission controllers, there is a chance that the values configured by the user will be modified by the API. This usually manifest as `Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply` and `produced an unexpected new value:` messages when applying.

To accommodate this, the `kubernetes_manifest` resources allows defining so-called "computed" fields. When an field is defined as "computed" Terraform will allow the final value stored in state after `apply` as returned by the API to be different than what the user requested.

The most common example of this is `metadata.annotations`. In some cases, the API will add extra annotations on top of the ones configured by the user. Unless the field is declared as "computed" Terraform will throw an error signaling that the state returned by the 'apply' operation is inconsistent with the value defined in the 'plan'.

To declare an field as "computed" add its full field path to the `computed_fields` field under the respective `kubernetes_manifest` resource. For example, to declare the "metadata.labels" field as "computed", add the following:

```
resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test-ns" {
  manifest = {
    ...
  }

  computed_fields = ["metadata.labels"]
 }
```

**IMPORTANT**: By default, `metadata.labels` and `metadata.annotations` are already included in the list. You don't have to set them explicitly in the `computed_fields` list. To turn off these defaults, set the value of `computed_fields` to an empty list or a concrete list of other fields. For example `computed_fields = []`.

The syntax for the field paths is the same as the one used in the `wait` block.

A field path is a string that describes the fully qualified address of a field within the resource, including its parent fields all the way up to "object". The syntax of a path string follows the rules below:

- Fields of objects are addressed with `.`
- Keys of a map field are addressed with `["<key-string>"]`
- Elements of a list or tuple field are addressed with `[<index-numeral>]`

  The following example waits for Kubernetes to create a ServiceAccount token in a Secret, where the `data` field of the Secret is a map.

  ```hcl
  wait {
    fields = {
      "data[\"token\"]" = ".+"
    }
  }
  ```

  You can use the [`type()`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/type) Terraform function to determine the type of a field. With the resource created and present in state, run `terraform console` and then the following command:

  ```hcl
  > type(kubernetes_manifest.my-secret.object.data)
    map(string)
  ```
