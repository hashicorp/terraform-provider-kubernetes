- `labels` (Map of String) Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) the role. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
- `name` (String) Name of the role, must be unique. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

  }

  rule {
    api_groups     = [""]
    resources      = ["pods"]
    resource_names = ["foo"]
    verbs          = ["get", "list", "watch"]
  }
