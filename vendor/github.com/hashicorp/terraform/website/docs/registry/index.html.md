# Terraform Registry

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) is a repository
of modules written by the Terraform community. The registry can
help you get started with Terraform more quickly, see examples of how
Terraform is written, and find pre-made modules for infrastructure components
you require.

The Terraform Registry is integrated directly into Terraform to make
consuming modules easy. See [the usage information](/docs/registry/modules/use.html#using-modules).

You can also publish your own modules on the Terraform Registry. You may
use the [public registry](https://registry.terraform.io) for public modules.
For private modules, you can use a [Private Registry](/docs/registry/private.html),
or [reference repositories and other sources directly](/docs/modules/sources.html).
Some features are available only for registry modules, such as versioning
and documentation generation.

Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the registry.
