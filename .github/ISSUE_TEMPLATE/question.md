Hi, please provide as much information as possible when asking your question. 
Please understand that we make a best effort attempt to address questions, but our focus is on provider development. It's still valuable to ask your question because you may receive help from the community, and help us understand common asks.
If you prefer, you can also ask your question in the Kubernetes community Slack channel [#terraform-providers](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CJY6ATQH4). ([Sign up here](http://slack.k8s.io/))
