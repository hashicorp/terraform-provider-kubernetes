# keyvaluetags

The `keyvaluetags` package is designed to provide a consistent interface for handling AWS resource key-value tags. Many of the AWS Go SDK services, implement their own Go struct with `Key` and `Value` fields (e.g. `athena.Tag`) while others simply use a map (e.g. `map[string]string`). These inconsistent implementations and numerous Go types makes the process of correctly working with each of the services a tedius, previously copy-paste-modify process.

This package instead implements a single `KeyValueTags` type, which covers all key-value handling logic such as merging tags and ignoring keys via functions on the single type. The underlying implementation is compatible with Go operations such as `len()`.

Full documentation for this package can be found on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/aws/internal/keyvaluetags).

Many AWS Go SDK services that support tagging have their service-specific Go type conversion functions to and from `KeyValueTags` code generated. Converting from `KeyValueTags` to AWS Go SDK types is done via `{SERVICE}Tags()` functions on the type, while converting from AWS Go SDK types to the `KeyValueTags` type is done via `{SERVICE}KeyValueTags()` functions. For more information about this code generation, see the [`generators/servicetags` README](generators/servicetags/README.md).

Some AWS Go SDK services that have common tag listing functionality (such as `ListTagsForResource` API call), also have auto-generated list functions. For more information about this code generation, see the [`generators/listtags` README](generators/listtags/README.md).

Some AWS Go SDK services that have common tagging update functionality (such as `TagResource` and `UntagResource` API calls), also have auto-generated update functions. For more information about this code generation, see the [`generators/updatetags` README](generators/updatetags/README.md).
